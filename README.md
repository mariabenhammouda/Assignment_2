## A loud cosmo

 shapes/color: is your image visually pleasing? how does the shape of the image relate with its colors? i there intended harmony or discord?

r/evolution: what kind of r/evolution is your piece based on (repetitive/random/semi-random/etc.)? what makes it move? what is the progression of the piece?

concept: what is the conceptual component of your piece? what idea does it represent? how accessible is that idea from a purely visual standpoint?

write-up: explain your creative process, your inspirations and your decision to stop at a certain point. are you satisfied with the work (it's ok not to be)? did you achieve what you expected? did you end up somewhere unexpected?
